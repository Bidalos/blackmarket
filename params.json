{"name":"Blackmarket","tagline":"blackmarket is a fan made application for the free to play MMORPG game Path of Exile","body":"Blackmarket is a Path of Exile items search tool that allows you to search what you want in easiest possible way. As easy just typing in \"90life 60res gloves\" in the search field and hit 'enter'. This will search for gloves with at least 90 life, at least 60 total elemental resistances, with buyout and online only, sorted cheapest first.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot:\r\n![screenshot-1](https://github.com/thirdy/blackmarket/blob/master/blackmarket/v0.2-pre-alpha-release-scrsht1.png)\r\n\r\n## An important note on Open Source\r\nBlackmarket is **100% free** and fully **open source** under GPLv2. In a nutshell, this means that this software will always be free, and anyone can take the source code and modify it for improvements. However, this will also require that all the released modified versions be free software as well.\r\n\r\nRead more about open source [here](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). The [GNU GPLv2 FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html) page is also a good read.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\nDownload latest version now from the [Releases](https://github.com/thirdy/blackmarket/releases) page.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nYou'll need to have the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed. You can download the latest version of Java [here](https://www.java.com). JRE is just like .NET Framework which is also a runtime environment, only easier to install and better :P. Blackmarket is tested with Java 8, but it should work with Java 7 as well.\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\nDouble click the blackmarket-<version>.jar. As simple as that.\r\n\r\n## Basic Usage\r\n1. Type in what you wanna search, for example: 500pdps 2hsword 5L6s\r\n2. Click _Search_ and wait for the results to show up.\r\n3. You click on any of the items to open up the _Item View Window_.\r\n4. Once you've decided to buy something, click _WTB_ button. This will copy a generated WTB message to your clipboard.\r\n5. Switch to in-game, open the chat window and press CTRL+V.\r\n6. Be friendly and happy trading!\r\n\r\n### Note on defaults\r\n* **League** - Set to Warbands by default\r\n* **With Buyout Only** - Set to true by default. To disable this, set buyoutOnly=false, buyoutOnlyCurrency=<blank>\r\nYou can change this via **blackmarket.properties** file which is found in your home directory/.blackmarket. E.g. C:\\Users\\<YourUserName>\\.blackmarket.\r\n\r\n## Advance Usage\r\n1. The _\"Blackmarket Language\"_ is designed to be customizable and extensible via _blackmarket.language_ file. The guide on editing this file has not yet materialized but here is an example:\r\n   * `cod  = name=Cloak of Defiance`\r\n   * `veil = name=Veil of the Night`\r\n2. You can also customize the **look and feel** via _lookAndFeel_ and _highlightColor_ properties in blackmarket.properties file. Below is a screenshot of what I've achieved while playing around with it:\r\n\r\n![screenshot-3](https://github.com/thirdy/blackmarket/blob/master/blackmarket/v0.2-pre-alpha-in-development.png)\r\n\r\n## Suggestions or Issues?\r\nFeel free to post your feedback/suggestions/bugs to the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/thirdy/blackmarket/issues).\r\n\r\n## Support Blackmarket\r\nIf like this tool, you can buy me a beer beer.png by clicking the Donate button below.\r\n\r\n_This software is fan-made and not affiliated with Grinding Gear Games in any way._\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-67852264-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
